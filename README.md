# blog_website
Using the Django web framework, I am building a personal blogging website with the goals of:
- Communicating my experiences and scientific topics that I find interesting to a wider audience that is easy to navigate
- Have a flexible admin interface to easily create and edit posts
- Contact form with email system
- Track the number of views on each blog
